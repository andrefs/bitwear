Using LEDs and Arduino Lilypad to dynamically display information on
clothes.

We're planning on sewing a LED matrix to a T-shirt and use a Arduino
Lilypad with a radio receiver to receive information and display it on
the matrix. We're hiring anyone with electronics knowledge and a
professional stitcher.
